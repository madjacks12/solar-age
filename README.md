## Planning

1. Project architecture.
  * initialize npm and install needed dependencies.
  * install jasmine and karma for testing.
  * install bower for moment.js to use to easily generate current time.

2. User Stories
  * As a user I want to enter my age into the application.
  * As a user I want to see my age in Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter years.
  * As a user I want to see how many years I have left to live on each planet.
